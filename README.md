# Introduction

KERIOX is an open source Rust implementation of the [ Key Event Receipt Infrastructure (KERI) ](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/keri), a system designed to provide a secure identifier-based trust spanning layer for any stack. [The current version of the KERI paper can be found here](https://github.com/SmithSamuelM/Papers/blob/master/whitepapers/KERI_WP_2.x.web.pdf).

KERI provides the same security and verifiability properties for transactions as a blockchain or distributed ledger can, without the overhead of requiring an absolute global ordering of transactions. Because of this, there is no need for a cannonical chain and thus there is no "KERI Chain" or "KERI Network". KERI Identifiers can be generated independantly in a self-sovereign and privacy-preserving manner and are secured via a self-certifying post-quantum resistant key management scheme based on blinded pre-rotation, auditable and flexible key events and a distributed conflict resolution algorithm called KAACE.

# Features

This implementation is still in an early stage. The planned outcomes of this effort are:
- A Core Library for KERI logic and data structures
- An Application which serves as a KERI "Agent" and can fulfill the roles described in the KAACE protocol
